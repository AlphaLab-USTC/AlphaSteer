This repository contains the official implementation of the paper: "AlphaSteer: Learning Refusal Steering with Principled Null-Space Constraint".

## Overview

AlphaSteer is a novel approach for refusal steering in large language models (LLMs) that leverages principled null-space constraints to effectively guide model responses while preserving the model's original capabilities.
